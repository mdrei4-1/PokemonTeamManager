# PokemonTeamManager
A small Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl Team manager I created for my final Database Systems Project.


For a video of this project in action, please use this link: https://youtu.be/eOxq7gnTQk4

This project was started before Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were released, so the data used is from Pokemon X and Y. 

The database for this project is obtained from https://veekun.com/dex/downloads. I have chosen not to include the database with this project, but it can be easily downloaded from the website (it is the link that says "Full database as gzipped SQLite").
